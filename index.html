                        <li>We believe this is also a good choice because it shows the numerical difference in electoral votes, rather than simply which side a state chose.</li>

                        <li>We believe this is a good, and smart choice. It helps to show where the baseline of the data is, and the position each data point is relative to that base level.</li>

                        <li>We believe this is bad choice because while purple and orange are two distinct colors, there seems to be no correlation between their selections. A scale from red to orange might have represented the data better.</li>
