                        <li>We believe it's a good choice because it represents the data as intended, with the colors associating with their respective parties.</li>

                        <li>We believe this is also a good choice because it shows the numerical difference in electoral votes, rather than simply which side a state chose.</li>

                    <li>Position: Both</li>

                        <li>Represents attribute of categorical type</li>
                        <li>We believe this isn't a bad choice, but it isn't super necessary. It shows where the votes are relative to each other.</li>

                        <li>Similar to what we wrote for Color, we believe this is a good choice because it connects the Color and Area channels.</li>

                        <li>We believe this is a good, and smart choice. It helps to show where the baseline of the data is, and the position each data point is relative to that base level.</li>

                        <li>We believe this is bad choice because while purple and orange are two distinct colors, there seems to be no correlation between their selections. A scale from red to orange might have represented the data better.</li>

                        <li>We believe this is a good choice and should have been the original choice of representation for the Avg LWTS for a batted ball.</li>

                        <li>Similar to what we wrote for Color: saturation, we believe this is a good choice because it effortlessly reperesents the groupings of data from each other, those being the below Avg, Avg, and above Avg LWTS.</li>
